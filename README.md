# python-newsfeed

## Description
A news / blog website to make posts, comment on, and upvote posts, all made by using Python. 
  
Motivation: To add another skill set to my coding.  

Why this project: This was a continuing education self-paced course provided by EdX's GW Fullstack Coding Bootcamp. 

What I learned: I learned how to set up a website with Python. It was very interesting to compare some of the differences between JavaScript/Node.js and Python to make a website.

  ## Installation
  Download the files from this GitHub. Install venv files necessary for making websites based on Python. Furthermore, using pip, install these dependencies:

```
bcrypt, Flask, gunicorn (if you plan to deploy), python-dotenv, SQLAlchemy, sqlalchemy-orm
```

  ## Usage
  Run the command `python3 seeds.py` from the root file to seed your database. Use Flask to run the server from your local machine by changing to a virutal environment with the command `. venv/bin/activate` followed by `python3 -m flask run`. Open the browser: http://127.0.0.1:5000/. This is a locally run server. 

  ## Credits
  EdX Bootcamp Full Stack Web Development Continuation Courses provided the code and I followed step by step to learn how to build a website with Python.

  ## Challenges and Future Improvements 
  Make it so that users can only upvote a post once (currently they can upvote for every time they click 'upvote')
